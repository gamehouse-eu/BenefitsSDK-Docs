Installation
======================

Add GameHouse Scoped Registry
------------------------------

To install the BenefitsSDK, you need to add it via the Unity Package Manager.

The first thing you need to do, is to add a new Scoped Registry to your project. To do this, go to Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager, and add the following scoped registry:

| Name: GameHouse
| URL: https://npm.pkg.github.com/@gamehouse-eu
| Scope: com.gamehouse

Install Benefits SDK Package
------------------------------

Once you've done this, you can open the Package Manager.

To open it, go to Window > Package Manager, click on the +, and 'add package by name'.

When prompted for a name, use `com.gamehouse.benefitssdk`.

This should install the Benefits SDK in your project, as well as all of it's dependencies.

Create SDK Settings
------------------------------

Before you can use the SDK, you need to create the settings file.

You can create one from the menu item GameHouse > Create Settings. This will be created in Assets/Resources folder.

Assembly Definition
------------------------------

The Benefits SDK uses it's own Assembly Definition. If you are using Assembly Definitions in your project, you will need to add the Benefits SDK to your `Assembly Definition Reference <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/assembly-definitions-referencing.html>`_.
