Testing your Integration
============================================
Before you do any testing in device, it's recommended that you test in the Editor.

We provide a scriptable object called `SimpleSDKMockSettings`, where you can define how you want the sdk to respond to your calls.

To enable the usage of this, you need to add the compiler flag `GHSDK_DEBUG` in Player Settings.

Once you have this enabled, you can test all of the different scenarios, to make sure the game is behaving properly.

After you validated that it's working properly, you can turn it off, and test with the real implementation.
