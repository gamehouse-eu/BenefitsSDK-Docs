Installation
======================

To install the BenefitsSDK, you need to add it via the Unity Package Manager.

The first you need to do, is to add a new Scoped Registry to your project. To do this, go to Edit > Project Settings > Package Manager, and add the following:

Name: GameHouse Sdk
URL: https://npm.pkg.github.com/@gamehouse-eu
Scope: com.gamehouse

Once you've done this, you can open the Package Manager.

To open it, go to Window > Package Manager, click on the +, and 'add package by name'.

When prompted for a name, use `com.gamehouse.benefitssdk`.

This should install the Benefits SDK in your project, as well as all of it's dependencies.

Before you can use the SDK, you need to create the settings file.gamehouse

You can create one from the menu item GameHouse > Create Settings. This will be created in Assets/Resources folder.
